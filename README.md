# Nuxt Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Server API & Admin

This project exposes CRUD endpoints under `/api/projects` that persist data to `server/data/projects.json`.

To protect the admin interface set an environment variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before starting the server. A simple back-office is available at `/admin` once authenticated.

### Example

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=mySecret bun run dev
```

After starting visit `http://localhost:3000/admin` to manage projects.

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```
